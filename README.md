# euler
A 2-D Euler solver for internal flows written in Fortran.

## todo

- [x] verify that the code works for mach 0.3, 0.5, 0.7
- [x] verify grid independence of solutions
- [ ] implement force calculations across bottom of the domain
- [ ] add support for supersonic inlet conditions
- [ ] extend support for different domains (i.e. nozzles)
- [ ] add support for Tecplot videos
- [ ] add support for other plotting software (since Tecplot is paywalled)
- [ ] couple with method of characteristics design tool
